# XML files
- JSON-in-XML files used to output format specific profiles
- Older versions have version numbers appended
- `dummy.xml`: An XML source file is need to configure a transformation scenario when running `json2xml.xsl`, even though the [*json-to-xml()* function](https://www.w3.org/2013/XSL/json/) parses data accessed at the given URL, not in a local file
